# 3D Dice - Day 132

I'm trying to learn how to implement 3d objects in CSS. I'm following along the tutorials of [David DeSandro](https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/). I want to make a 3d cube that is basically a dice so it uses a bit of css images by positioning
the circles relative to their parents.

This is how it ended up looking as:
