# Podcast Director - Day 131

For this project I want to practice array methods `.filter()` `.map()` and so on since javascript30's day 4 is all about arrays
I decided to make a simple app that lists some of my favorite podcasts and users can search, sort and filter the data.
so lets get started

## Walkthrough

This time around, I wanted to right off the bat make the application responsive instread of leaving it as a last step so lets get started on that.
